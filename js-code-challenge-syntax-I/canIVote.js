// The most common minimum age to vote is 18. Write a function canIVote() that takes in a number, representing the personâ€™s age, and returns the boolean true if they are 18 years old or older, and the boolean false if they are not.

// Write your function here:

/*
const canIVote = (age) => {
  if (age >= 18) {
      return true;
  } 
  else {
      return false;
  }
}
*/

const canIVote = (age) =>
  age >= 18 ? true : false;

// Uncomment the line below when you're ready to try out your function
console.log(canIVote(18)) // Should print true

// We encourage you to add more function calls of your own to test your code!
